Definition:
    Docker container is lightweight, standalone, executable package of software includes everything needed to run the application.
    Docker Engine = Docker CLI (client) + Docker API & Docker Daemon (server) | Open Source

Virtual Machines vs Container:
        App #1              App #2 
        Bin/Lib             Bin/Lib 
        OS                  OS                           App #1             App #2
    Virtual Hardware    Virtual Hardware                   Bin/Lib            Bin/Lib   
        VM #1               VM #2                       Container #1        Container #2

Docker/Linux Building Blocks:
    Namespaces:
        Isolate host system resources from container resources
        Ex - Pid Namespace: Pid running in host are not visible inside the container.
        Ex - User Namespace: Same user can have different previleges in container and in host.
    Control Groups(cgroups):
        Organize processes in groups then limit and monitor access to certain resources.
        Ex - Limit on utilization on cpu, memory, devices and pids (30% of CPU, 50MB of memory)
    Union Filesystem:
        docker uses overlayfs
        combines different layers having different files and can be seen together in a single file system.
        contains 3 layers - Overlay, Upper, Lower
        Lower layer contains some shared files that will be used/commann in multiple docker images to lower the data transfer.
        Upper layer takes the precendence when same/modifies file is present in in Lower and Upper layer.
        Ex - When the new docker image is generated, File-2b will overide File-2a and will not contain File-4.
            Overlay     File-1        File-2b     File-3
                          |             |           | 
            Upper         |           File-2b     File-3      File-4 Deleted
            Lower       File-1        File-2a                 File-4

Volumes:
    Volume Mount:
        Stores data in docker container
        Faster performance
    Bind Mount:
        Stores data in host
        Lower performance
